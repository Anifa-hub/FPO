                â€œHelp others without any reason and give without the expectation of receiving anything in return<br>
                It's not how much we give but how much love we put into giving.<br>
                <br>If you haven't got any charity in your heart, you have the worst kind of heart trouble. 
                <br>Every good act is charity. A man's true wealth hereafter is the good that he does in this world to his fellows
